CAL9000
=========

Inspired by 2001 Space Odyssey's HAL9000, CAL9000 is a Color Analysis Bot. Given an image, CAL will analyze its pixel colors and give a humanlike opinion on the image: "Wow, I see some lavender tones and a whole lot of hot pink in this image!".

##Current Status

CAL 9000 is in the middle of development! At may be broken at any given time. Currently working on a 3d bucket search of colors dataset to allow for blazing fast similar color detection!
