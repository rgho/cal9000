>> Challenges
	> No Backend, all browser.

	> Color dataset of human names to hex / rgb
		+ Scraped from Crayola, etc.
		+ Manually cull all the stupid names

	> Text to Voice
		+Use an API

	> RGB diff for most similar colors does not map to human perception of similar colors. 
	
	> Speed Optimizations (shoutout Mary + Alan)
		+ Rather than loop over all colors in dataset for each pixel in image, partition the dataset into cubes. Then figure out the closest cube to a given pixel and search the cube and surrounding cubes for "best fit color"

	> Speed Optimization - (shoutout Adam)
		+ Shrink the image.

	> Synchronize text appearance with voice
		+ Javascript Events (canPlaySound)
		+ Dynamically adjust callback time based on . , ! and length of word about to be shown
		+ wait for voice to load before showing desc.

	> CAL's pulsing red effect (All credit to Adam)
		+ Based on voice, using Audio API / Volume levels.
